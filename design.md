## Hierarchy and layout
### What is the most important message/product on the page?
Presentation and information about relevant cars to rent for the customer

### What is the order of importance for the different elements?
The first (from the top) is company name.
The second is navigation so that the customer can find what they look for.
The third is page content depending on where they have navigated.
The most important of these is the cars overview where available cars are displayed.

### What sections will there be on the page?
At the top-level we are using a three-part header, main, footer layout.
Within the header there will be logo, company name, and site-navigation.
In the main section, the content for each page will be rendered dynamically.
In the footer, there will be "contact information" and the required project disclaimer.

### What layout(s) will you use for these sections?
The website uses 12-column layout.
The header will always have a logo with company name and navigation.
When you hover over the navigation bar options, they will change color and show which page you would select.
Footer will stay the same. Instead of links to the contact information, 
there will be used icons that describe which service they would represent.

## Images
### Gather the available images
We have gathered some of the images suggested for the cars, 
but not all were available. 
Due to the nature of the site and development,
we will use placeholders for the images that have yet to be found or gathered.

### Will there be text on images sor aside images?
There will be both text on images and aside images.
On the home page we use an image where the text is over it,
while on the cars, page we will have text next to images.

### Will we use clear images or a color-overlay?
There will be used clear images.

### Will there be blur for images?
There will be no blur on the images, but shadows.

## Icons
### Will we use icons and for what?
There will be used icons.
The icons from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) fit our style quite well.

### Colored or black-and-white/greyscale icons?
Due to the style of our page, the icons will be monochromatic.

## Typography
### Should it by a Serif or Sans-Serif font?
As we mainly aim for a professional look, we will use sans serif fonts.

### Bold or thin font?
We are using bold fonts for some headings and thin fonts for some.

### Rounded or sharp edges?
We use a mixture.
When we are using rounded edges, it is's not a large amount of rounding

## Border rounding
### How rounded should be the edges, according to the theme?
In general, there will be a rule of 12 px rounding for the edges, 
but in certain cases where this does not fit the item, it will be adjusted.

## Shadows
### How much shadow will we use in general, according to the theme? 
There will be used some shadow, but not too much.
