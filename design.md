Presentation and information about relevant cars to rent for the customer

## What is the order of importance for the different elements?
The first (from the top) is company name.
The second is navigation so that the customer can find what they look for.
The third is page content depending on where they have navigated.
The most important of these is the cars overview where available cars are displayed.

## What sections will there be on the page?
At the top-level we are using a three-part header, main, footer layout.
Within the header there will be logo, company name, and site-navigation.
In the main section, the content for each page will be rendered dynamically.
In the footer, there will be "contact information" and the required project disclaimer.

## What layout(s) will you use for these sections?
The header will always have a logo with company name and navigation.
When you hover over the navigation bar options, they will change color and show which page you would select.
Footer will stay the same. Instead of links to the contact information, 
there will be used icons that describe which service they would represent.
